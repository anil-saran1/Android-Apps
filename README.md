This repository contains a set of Android applications developed using Java and Android Studio as part of my learning in mobile application development and software engineering.
The goal of these projects is to practice real implementation of concepts such as activity lifecycle management, local database handling, UI design, and API communication.

4.JokeApp: A simple application that fetches and displays random jokes using an external API.

Technologies Used-
1.Language: Java
2.Development Environment: Android Studio
3.User Interface: XML Layouts, RecyclerView, CardView, Material Design components

Database: SQLite (local storage)
